# Setmaker

An Elm implementation of Michael Buchler's [Setmaker](https://myweb.fsu.edu/mbuchler/setmaker.html).

Setmaker features a host of tools for working with pitch-class sets (where octaves are equivalent). One can view a wide variety of set properties, combine subsets into larger sets, view subsets of supersets (and even mutual supersets), view all sets that have certain interval-class features, check transformational (including split transformational) mappings of one set (not set class) onto another, and compare multiple sets using a wide variety of pc-based similarity measures. Setmaker works with both Forte's and Rahn's prime form algorithms.
